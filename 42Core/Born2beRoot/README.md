## Introduction

The **Born2beRoot** project is part of the 42 curriculum and aims to familiarize students with Unix systems and the process of setting up a virtual machine with a Linux distribution. The objective is to create a fully-functional, isolated Linux environment that emulates the root user in a secure manner. This project provides hands-on experience with system administration, understanding the structure of a Linux environment, and working with essential tools such as SSH, virtualization, and basic system configuration.

The main goal is to create a personal virtual machine, which includes configuring it, setting up SSH access, and ensuring it meets certain security requirements. Through this project, students learn how to interact with Linux at a low level and how to securely administer a system.

## Features

- **Virtual Machine Setup**: The project involves setting up a virtual machine using software like VirtualBox or VMware and installing a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu).
- **System Configuration**: Configuring the system with essential tools, including setting up SSH access and configuring the root user account securely.
- **Security Hardening**: Applying security measures, such as creating a non-root user, setting up proper file permissions, and ensuring the system is secure from external threats.
- **Scripting**: Writing scripts to automate certain setup tasks, such as installing packages or configuring system settings.
- **SSH Access**: Configuring SSH to access the virtual machine remotely and securely.
- **System Monitoring**: Ensuring the virtual machine is running smoothly, and configuring basic monitoring tools to track system performance.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Linux System Setup**: This project gave me valuable hands-on experience setting up a Linux system from scratch. I learned how to install and configure a Linux distribution and interact with the system at a low level.
   
2. **Security Best Practices**: One of the key takeaways was learning how to harden a system for security. This involved setting up secure root access, managing users, and configuring firewalls and permissions.

3. **Virtualization and VM Management**: Setting up a virtual machine was an essential part of the project. I gained practical experience with virtual machine software, such as VirtualBox or VMware, and how to configure virtual environments for secure testing.

4. **Remote Access with SSH**: I learned how to configure and secure SSH access to my virtual machine, allowing for secure remote login. This knowledge is essential for managing servers in a production environment.

5. **Automation with Scripting**: The project involved automating the installation of packages and the configuration of the system using scripts. This helped me learn how to write effective shell scripts for system administration tasks.

6. **System Maintenance**: I gained experience maintaining a virtualized system, ensuring it remains up-to-date, secure, and properly configured for long-term use.
