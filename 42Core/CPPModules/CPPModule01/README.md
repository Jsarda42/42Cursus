## Introduction

**CPP Module 01** builds upon the basics covered in **Module 00** and delves into more advanced concepts of C++ programming. This module introduces object-oriented programming (OOP), focusing on classes and objects. The goal is to teach the core principles of OOP, including how to define and use classes, constructors, destructors, and member functions.

Additionally, the module covers deeper insights into manipulating data and memory with more complex data structures, enabling students to create more efficient, modular, and reusable code.

## Features

- **Classes and Objects**: This module teaches how to define and use classes, which are the fundamental building blocks of OOP. We learn how to create objects, instantiate them, and understand the relationship between classes and their instances.

- **Constructors and Destructors**: Understanding the role of constructors and destructors is a key feature of the module. Constructors are used to initialize objects, while destructors handle cleanup when objects are destroyed.

- **Member Functions**: Learn how to define and implement member functions, which allow objects to perform specific tasks or manipulate internal data.

- **Encapsulation**: This principle of OOP ensures that data is protected from unauthorized access and modifications. The module teaches how to apply access specifiers (private, public, protected) to safeguard object properties and methods.

- **Operator Overloading**: We are introduced to the concept of overloading operators, which allows custom operations on objects, making code more intuitive and readable.

- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: The module introduces the concepts of memory management, including the `new` and `delete` operators for dynamically allocating and deallocating memory.

- **Friend Functions**: We also explore the concept of friend functions, which allow non-member functions to access private and protected members of a class, providing flexibility when needed.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Object-Oriented Programming Basics**: I gained an understanding of the fundamentals of OOP, specifically how to use classes and objects to model real-world entities. This helps in organizing code and making it more reusable and maintainable.

2. **Constructors and Destructors**: I learned how to use constructors to initialize objects with default or user-defined values, and destructors to clean up memory when objects are no longer needed. This is essential for managing resources in C++.

3. **Encapsulation and Data Protection**: I understood the importance of encapsulation in OOP, which protects object data and ensures that it's only accessed or modified through well-defined interfaces (public methods).

4. **Operator Overloading**: I practiced overloading operators to customize how operators behave with user-defined types. This helps in making objects behave similarly to built-in types and makes the code more readable and intuitive.

5. **Memory Management**: I became familiar with dynamic memory allocation using the `new` and `delete` operators, which is important in controlling memory usage and preventing memory leaks in more complex C++ programs.

6. **Friend Functions**: I learned how friend functions can be used to give certain non-member functions access to the private members of a class, which can be useful in certain design patterns or when working with helper functions.

7. **Designing and Implementing Classes**: I practiced designing simple classes with constructors, member functions, and access control, helping me build more organized, modular code for real-world applications.

8. **Debugging Class-Based Programs**: Working with object-oriented code in this module helped me understand common errors in class-based programs, such as improper initialization or memory management, and how to debug them effectively.
