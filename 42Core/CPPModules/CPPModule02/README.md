## Introduction

**CPP Module 02** focuses on more advanced topics in C++ programming, particularly on the use of **dynamic memory**, **advanced object-oriented programming (OOP)**, and **working with complex data structures**. This module emphasizes the importance of handling memory manually using pointers and dynamic allocation, which are crucial for efficient and optimized C++ programming.

The module also delves deeper into more advanced OOP concepts, such as **copy constructors**, **assignment operators**, and **deep vs shallow copying**. Additionally, students are introduced to the powerful concept of **iterators** and working with **containers** like `std::vector` and `std::list`.

The goal of this module is to give students a solid foundation in managing memory manually, writing efficient code, and working with more complex data structures in C++.

## Features

- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Learn how to dynamically allocate and deallocate memory using **pointers**, `new`, and `delete`. The module focuses on manual memory management, an essential skill in C++.

- **Deep vs Shallow Copying**: Understand the difference between **deep copying** and **shallow copying**, and how to properly implement copy constructors and assignment operators to handle these scenarios.

- **Copy Constructors**: Learn how to create a copy constructor to correctly initialize an object with the values of another object, ensuring deep copying when necessary to avoid memory issues.

- **Assignment Operators**: Implement and understand the importance of assignment operators for assigning one object to another while ensuring proper memory management and avoiding issues like memory leaks.

- **Iterators**: Work with iterators, which provide a way to traverse through containers (such as `std::vector`, `std::list`, etc.) in a standard and efficient manner.

- **Containers**: Gain familiarity with using standard C++ containers like **`std::vector`** and **`std::list`**, which are fundamental for working with collections of data.

- **Exception Handling**: Understand how to implement basic exception handling in C++ to manage errors and exceptions that might arise during the execution of a program.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: I became proficient in using **pointers** to dynamically allocate and deallocate memory with `new` and `delete`. This knowledge is crucial for managing resources efficiently in C++ applications.

2. **Copy Constructors and Assignment Operators**: I learned the importance of implementing **copy constructors** and **assignment operators** to avoid shallow copies, which could lead to problems like double deletion and memory leaks. This helps ensure that objects are copied correctly.

3. **Deep vs Shallow Copying**: The module helped me understand the crucial difference between deep and shallow copying. I learned how to properly implement deep copies to prevent unintended sharing of resources between objects.

4. **Iterators**: I gained experience working with iterators, which are essential for traversing through elements in containers like `std::vector` and `std::list`. This helps in writing more general and efficient code.

5. **Containers in C++**: I learned how to use the **C++ Standard Library containers**, such as `std::vector` and `std::list`. These containers provide efficient ways to store and manage collections of data.

6. **Memory Management Challenges**: I became familiar with potential pitfalls in memory management, including memory leaks, dangling pointers, and the importance of properly releasing allocated memory.

7. **Exception Handling**: The module introduced basic exception handling using `try`, `catch`, and `throw`, enabling me to write more robust code that can gracefully handle errors and exceptions.

8. **Complex Data Structures**: I learned how to manage more complex data structures with dynamic memory, iterators, and containers, which are the building blocks for creating more sophisticated applications in C++.
