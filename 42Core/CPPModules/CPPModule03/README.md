## Introduction

**CPP Module 03** takes a deeper dive into **C++ object-oriented programming** by focusing on **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **abstract classes**. The primary goal of this module is to introduce students to the core principles of inheritance and polymorphism in C++, which allow for the creation of more flexible, reusable, and modular code. This module also explores the concept of **virtual functions** and how they enable dynamic method resolution at runtime.

Through the implementation of various exercises, students will also gain practical experience with **abstract classes**, which define interfaces for derived classes to implement, and **pure virtual functions**, which further enhance the flexibility of class design.

This module also emphasizes the importance of **code organization** and **reusability**, which are essential for creating scalable and maintainable software.

## Features

- **Inheritance**: Learn how to create a base class and derive new classes from it. This allows for code reuse and the creation of a more flexible program structure, minimizing redundancy.

- **Polymorphism**: This module teaches the concept of **polymorphism**, allowing derived classes to have different implementations of the same method. Polymorphism enables the same method name to behave differently based on the object type.

- **Virtual Functions**: Understand how to define **virtual functions** in base classes to allow derived classes to override them, enabling dynamic method resolution (runtime polymorphism).

- **Abstract Classes**: Abstract classes are introduced as classes that cannot be instantiated directly but define essential interfaces that derived classes must implement. These classes allow for code that is highly flexible and extensible.

- **Pure Virtual Functions**: Learn how to use **pure virtual functions** to create classes that are meant to be abstract and force derived classes to implement specific methods.

- **Dynamic Casting**: Get familiar with **dynamic_cast**, which allows for safe casting between related types, especially when dealing with polymorphism and base/derived class hierarchies.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Inheritance**: I gained a solid understanding of how inheritance works in C++, enabling me to create a clear hierarchy of classes and reuse code effectively. Inheritance allows for better code organization and avoids code duplication.

2. **Polymorphism**: I learned how to implement polymorphism in C++ by using virtual functions, which allows derived classes to have their own versions of functions that are dynamically called at runtime. This concept is crucial for designing extensible systems.

3. **Virtual Functions and Dynamic Dispatch**: I understood how to define **virtual functions** in base classes and how they enable dynamic method dispatch. This allows programs to be more flexible, as the correct function is called based on the object type at runtime.

4. **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**: I explored abstract classes, which define a blueprint for derived classes. These classes cannot be instantiated directly and require derived classes to implement the required functions. This helps in defining flexible, reusable code components.

5. **Pure Virtual Functions**: I became proficient in implementing pure virtual functions to enforce that derived classes implement specific functionality, thus enabling a clear contract between base and derived classes.

6. **Code Modularity and Reusability**: The module helped me improve my ability to design programs that are modular and reusable, ensuring that new functionality can be easily added by extending existing classes.

7. **Safe Casting with `dynamic_cast`**: I gained hands-on experience with **`dynamic_cast`**, which is useful for safely casting pointers or references in class hierarchies, particularly in polymorphic scenarios.

8. **Design Patterns**: The module introduced me to design patterns that leverage inheritance and polymorphism, such as the **Strategy** and **State** patterns, which enhance the maintainability and scalability of C++ programs.
