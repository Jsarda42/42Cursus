## Introduction

**CPP Module 04** focuses on advanced object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques and introduces the **STL (Standard Template Library)**. The main objective of this module is to deepen your understanding of classes and templates in C++, and teach how to use **iterators**, **templates**, and **containers** from the C++ Standard Library.

This module covers a variety of features, including the implementation of generic functions with templates, the creation of your own template classes, and an introduction to STL containers such as `std::vector`, `std::map`, and `std::set`. Additionally, students will gain a solid understanding of **smart pointers** and how to use them for automatic memory management.

The aim of the module is to enable students to write more flexible, efficient, and reusable code by using templates and STL containers.

## Features

- **Templates**: Learn how to define and use templates in C++. Templates allow writing functions and classes that work with any data type, making your code more generic and reusable. Youâ€™ll learn about function templates, class templates, and template specialization.

- **STL Containers**: Explore the powerful **Standard Template Library** (STL) in C++. Learn to use containers such as **`std::vector`**, **`std::map`**, and **`std::set`** for managing collections of data. These containers offer built-in functionality for adding, removing, and accessing data.

- **Iterators**: Get introduced to **iterators**, which provide a standard way to access and traverse elements of containers. Learn to use iterators with STL containers and how they allow for easy manipulation of data.

- **Smart Pointers**: Learn about **smart pointers**, such as **`std::unique_ptr`** and **`std::shared_ptr`**, which automatically manage the memory of dynamically allocated objects and prevent memory leaks.

- **Exception Handling**: While it may have been covered in previous modules, **exception handling** is revisited with more complex cases, including handling exceptions in template classes and STL containers.

- **Custom Template Classes**: Learn how to define your own template classes and how to use them effectively in larger programs. Custom templates allow for efficient memory and data management.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Templates in C++**: I learned how to define and use **function templates** and **class templates** in C++. This allows for the creation of generic functions and classes that work with any data type, reducing redundancy and improving code reusability.

2. **STL Containers**: I became proficient in using **STL containers** such as **`std::vector`**, **`std::map`**, and **`std::set`**. These containers provide an efficient way to manage collections of data, offering built-in functions for adding, removing, and accessing elements.

3. **Iterators and STL**: I gained experience using **iterators** to traverse through elements in STL containers. This standard approach to data access and manipulation ensures consistency and flexibility when working with different types of data structures.

4. **Smart Pointers**: I learned about **smart pointers** and how they provide automatic memory management. By using **`std::unique_ptr`** and **`std::shared_ptr`**, I no longer need to manually manage the memory of dynamically allocated objects, reducing the risk of memory leaks.

5. **Template Specialization**: I explored **template specialization**, which allows the creation of different implementations for a specific type, providing greater flexibility in handling different types of data.

6. **Exception Handling with Templates**: I revisited **exception handling** and learned how to handle exceptions in the context of template functions and classes. This knowledge helps in writing robust and fault-tolerant code.

7. **Custom Template Classes**: I learned how to design and implement custom template classes, which are useful for building complex data structures and algorithms that are type-independent.

8. **Efficient and Reusable Code**: By utilizing **templates** and **STL containers**, I learned how to write more **efficient**, **modular**, and **reusable** code. Templates allow me to create generic algorithms, while STL containers help in managing data effectively.
