## Introduction

The **NetPractice** project is a training platform designed to help you test and improve your knowledge of networking concepts. Instead of building your own network application, you work with a simulated environment available through a web interface. This platform is used to practice and understand core networking topics, such as protocols, IP addressing, routing, DNS, HTTP, and more.

The exercises are structured to test different aspects of networking, and they provide practical experience with tasks that network professionals deal with regularly. Through this platform, you can simulate real network environments, troubleshoot, and implement solutions in a controlled, educational setting.

## Features

- **Interactive Networking Exercises**: The platform provides a series of interactive exercises to test various networking concepts, such as:
  - IP addressing and subnetting
  - Routing tables and network configurations
  - DNS resolution and HTTP requests
  - Network protocols (TCP/IP, UDP, etc.)
  
- **Web-Based Training Interface**: All exercises are accessible through a web interface that you open in your browser. This eliminates the need for setting up any additional software or virtual machines.

- **Simulated Network Environment**: The network environments you work with are not real, but simulated. This allows you to practice network configurations, troubleshoot problems, and run commands in a safe, virtual space.

- **Real-Time Feedback**: After completing tasks, you receive immediate feedback, helping you understand if you've applied concepts correctly. This feedback is crucial for improving your networking skills.

- **Progress Tracking**: The platform tracks your progress as you complete exercises, helping you monitor your improvement over time.

- **Educational Content**: Each task is paired with explanations, guiding you through networking concepts and best practices. This helps reinforce learning while testing your abilities.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Networking Protocols**: By completing exercises focused on different protocols (TCP/IP, UDP, DNS, HTTP, etc.), I gained a deeper understanding of how these protocols work and how they are used in real-world networks.

2. **Subnetting and IP Addressing**: The exercises helped me practice and refine my skills in IP addressing, subnetting, and CIDR notation. Understanding how to divide and allocate IP addresses is essential for configuring networks.

3. **Routing and Network Configuration**: I gained hands-on experience with routing tables, setting up static routes, and configuring network interfaces. These are key concepts in network management and design.

4. **DNS and Domain Resolution**: Working with DNS tasks helped me understand how domain names are resolved to IP addresses, as well as how DNS servers work to handle queries.

5. **Network Troubleshooting**: The platform provided various scenarios where I had to troubleshoot network issues, including misconfigured IP addresses, routing problems, and connectivity issues. This taught me valuable diagnostic skills.

6. **Practical Application of Networking Concepts**: Although the networks are simulated, they mimic real-world situations, allowing me to apply my knowledge in a practical context. This helped reinforce theoretical learning with hands-on experience.

7. **Time Management**: Working through timed exercises helped me improve my ability to work under pressure and think quickly, simulating real-world troubleshooting scenarios where time is often a critical factor.
