## Introduction

The **Philosophers** project simulates a problem where several philosophers sit around a table, thinking and eating. The goal is to implement a simulation where the philosophers are trying to eat while respecting certain rules and avoiding deadlock and starvation.

The project helps to develop an understanding of **multithreading**, **synchronization**, and **process management** in C. Philosophers need to alternate between thinking and eating, using two forks (shared resources) that are needed to eat. The challenge lies in avoiding deadlock (when all philosophers are stuck waiting for forks) and ensuring that each philosopher gets a chance to eat.

The task involves using threads to represent the philosophers and synchronizing their actions using mutexes and other synchronization techniques to ensure the program runs without issues.

## Features

- **Multithreading**: Philosophers are represented by threads, each running concurrently and alternating between thinking and eating.
  
- **Fork Management**: Each philosopher needs two forks to eat, and forks are shared between them. The challenge is to ensure that philosophers don't deadlock (i.e., wait forever for forks) or experience starvation (i.e., never get to eat).

- **Synchronization**: Mutexes are used to prevent race conditions when philosophers access shared resources (the forks). Proper synchronization ensures the program runs smoothly and avoids errors like accessing shared resources simultaneously.

- **Philosopher Behavior**: Each philosopher alternates between thinking and eating. The thinking time is random, while the eating time is a fixed duration, and each philosopher must wait to acquire forks before eating.

- **Deadlock Prevention**: The main goal of this project is to prevent deadlock. Philosophers must not enter a state where all are waiting for a fork, so strategies like "odd/even philosopher behavior" or timing constraints may be implemented.

- **Starvation Prevention**: The system should also ensure that no philosopher is left without food for too long. Even if some philosophers are eating, all philosophers must eventually get a chance to eat.

- **Simulation Time**: The simulation will run for a specified amount of time or until all philosophers have eaten a certain number of times.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Multithreading and Concurrency**: The biggest lesson from this project was learning how to handle concurrency in C. I gained a deeper understanding of threads, how to create them, and how to manage them using synchronization primitives like mutexes.

2. **Mutexes and Locks**: Using mutexes to manage shared resources between multiple threads was crucial to prevent race conditions. I learned how to properly lock and unlock mutexes to ensure that no two philosophers can access the same fork at the same time.

3. **Deadlock and Starvation Prevention**: I learned how to design the program to prevent deadlock, ensuring that philosophers don't wait forever for forks. Additionally, I worked on techniques to prevent starvation by giving each philosopher a fair chance to eat.

4. **Thread Communication**: The project also helped me understand the importance of thread communication and how threads can be coordinated to share data without conflicts. I learned about using conditions and mutexes to manage the state of the philosophers.

5. **Problem Decomposition**: The problem required breaking down a complex real-world scenario (philosophers eating) into smaller, manageable tasks. Designing the simulation and ensuring that it works under all conditions taught me how to approach complex problems systematically.

6. **Performance Considerations**: The project made me consider the performance of multithreaded applications, specifically how to manage synchronization efficiently to avoid unnecessary delays or resource contention.

7. **Race Conditions and Debugging**: Identifying and debugging race conditions and ensuring thread safety were major learning points. I had to debug issues related to improper synchronization and ensure the program executed correctly under different scenarios.
