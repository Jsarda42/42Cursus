## Introduction

The **Ft_Transcendance Project** is a single-page application (SPA) built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Vanilla JavaScript**, **Django**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Bootstrap**. The project was developed by a team of 5, with the goal of creating an interactive platform that includes user authentication, dynamic content, and a visually appealing, responsive design.

The project also includes a **Pong game**, implemented with **Vanilla JavaScript**. This game is an engaging feature of the application, allowing users to play a simple, yet fun, retro game directly within the platform.

I was involved in all aspects of the project but took on the role of **project manager** at the beginning, coordinating the development tasks, managing the timeline, and ensuring that the team worked efficiently and effectively.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Implemented user registration, login, and authentication features using Django's built-in authentication system. Users can create accounts, log in, and log out securely.

- **Dynamic Content**: Used **Vanilla JavaScript** to fetch and display dynamic content on the page, providing an interactive experience for the user.

- **Pong Game**: Developed a simple but fun **Pong game** implemented entirely in **Vanilla JavaScript**. The game allows users to control paddles and challenge each other in a retro-style competitive environment directly in the web application.

- **Database Integration**: Set up **PostgreSQL** as the database for storing user data, preferences, and other dynamic content. The backend was connected to the database using Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).

- **Responsive Design**: The project was designed with a **mobile-first approach** using **Bootstrap**. The interface adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring an optimal user experience.

- **Single-Page Application (SPA)**: The app is designed as a single-page application (SPA), meaning that navigation and content updates are handled dynamically without refreshing the entire page, offering a smoother user experience.

- **RESTful API**: Built a RESTful API using Django to handle interactions with the database and serve content dynamically to the front-end. This allows for smooth communication between the front-end and back-end.

- **Project Management**: As the project manager, I coordinated the development tasks, set deadlines, and ensured the team followed a structured workflow. I organized regular meetings to review progress and help resolve any roadblocks the team encountered.

- **Collaboration and Version Control**: Utilized **Git** and **GitHub** for version control, ensuring smooth collaboration between team members. We followed a Git branching strategy to maintain clean code and avoid conflicts during development.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Project Management Experience**: I gained valuable experience as a **project manager**, where I was responsible for coordinating the team, setting deadlines, and ensuring that everyone was on track. This helped me develop leadership and communication skills, as well as the ability to manage and resolve conflicts in a collaborative environment.

2. **Backend Development with Django**: I became proficient in **Django** for developing backend applications, including handling **user authentication**, managing databases, and setting up RESTful APIs. This gave me a deeper understanding of web frameworks and server-side development.

3. **Database Management with PostgreSQL**: I learned how to set up and manage a **PostgreSQL** database in the context of a web application. Using **Django ORM** allowed me to interact with the database efficiently without writing raw SQL queries, streamlining data management.

4. **Frontend Development with Vanilla JavaScript**: I enhanced my skills in **Vanilla JavaScript** for making the website dynamic and responsive. The project helped me understand how to manage state and dynamically render content on the client-side without relying on third-party libraries.

5. **Responsive Design with Bootstrap**: I gained experience in creating **responsive** layouts with **Bootstrap**, ensuring that the web page looks good on any device, from mobile phones to desktops. This taught me how to use CSS frameworks effectively to speed up development and ensure good user experience across different screen sizes.

6. **Team Collaboration**: Working with a team of 5 gave me insights into the importance of communication and collaboration. We used **Git** for version control and **GitHub** for code reviews and tracking progress. I learned how to manage pull requests, resolve merge conflicts, and maintain a clean repository.

7. **Agile Workflow and Task Management**: By organizing tasks and setting deadlines, I learned how to manage projects in an agile manner. I used tools like **ClickUp** to ensure smooth communication and task tracking throughout the project.

8. **Error Handling and Debugging**: Through the development process, I encountered several debugging challenges, especially with database queries, JavaScript errors, and cross-browser compatibility issues. I improved my problem-solving skills by troubleshooting and fixing issues in the codebase.

9. **Security and Best Practices**: I learned important security best practices, especially in terms of **user authentication**, preventing common vulnerabilities like **SQL injection** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, and securing the application using Djangoâ€™s security features.

10. **Scalability Considerations**: Although the project was small in scope, I began to think about how the project could scale. This included planning for database optimizations, efficient API calls, and load balancing if the application were to grow.
